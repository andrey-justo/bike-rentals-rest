# Application bike-rentals-rest 

This application is a sample project to create a REST service.
The REST service is in construction.

But now we have a core class for a bike rental product.
Here, we have 3 concepts:

- Account
```
This concept represents an account for customer. The account can have a limited number of discounts for family and also, has a address  
```
- Order
```
This concept represents a rental order made by a account customer. The order has entry date, deliver date, type of payment.
```
- Bill
```
This concept represents a bill generated by each order. 
The bill has informations about payment, cancellation and discounts.
Once a bill has created, you must pay or cancel it in order to give discounts or change any information.
```


# Installation Requirements
- git clone ${project}
- mongodb 3.4.+
- Java 8


# Test, Code Coverage and check Bad Pratices
```sh
./gradlew clean findbugsAll
```
The command will generate 3 types of reports
- 1 - executes JUnit Tests and generate html files in bike-rentals-core/build/reports/tests/test/index.html
- 2 - executes Jacoco Code Coverage and generate html files in bike-rentals-core/build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html. Also it generates a .exec file to use in a Sonar integration
- 3 - executes Findbugs plugin and generate html files in bike-rentals-core/build/reports/findbugs/main.html
